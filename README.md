# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. To download and install Windows 11 from the official Microsoft website, I followed these steps:

 I visited (https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11). Then, I chose the appropriate download option, such as "Windows 11 Installation Assistant," "Create Windows 11 Installation Media," or "Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO)." When I used the Installation Assistant, I clicked "Download Now," ran the tool, and followed the on-screen instructions to upgrade my current system. For creating installation media, I downloaded the Media Creation Tool, ran it, and followed the prompts to create a bootable USB drive or DVD. When I decided to download the ISO file, I selected the edition and language, downloaded the file, and used it to create installation media or mounted it to upgrade. Finally, once the download and preparation were complete, I followed the installation instructions, ensured my device met the system requirements, and backed up important data.

 unfortunately my machine was not able to supprt it

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. 
   To download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website, I followed these steps:

First, I visited the Visual Studio Code download page(https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Then, I selected the appropriate version for my operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). I clicked on the download link, and once the file was downloaded, I ran the installer. During the installation process, I followed the on-screen instructions, chose the installation location, and selected any additional tasks, such as creating a desktop icon or adding Visual Studio Code to the PATH. After the installation was complete, I launched Visual Studio Code and configured any necessary extensions and settings to suit my development needs.For example prettier to make my code look smart

3. Set Up Version Control System:
    
    To install Git, configure it on my local machine, and set up a GitHub account, I followed these steps:

First, I visited (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and downloaded the appropriate installer for my operating system. After downloading, I ran the installer and followed the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Once Git was installed, I opened a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and configured my user name and email using the following commands: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"`. Next, I created a GitHub account by visiting [GitHub](https://github.com) and signing up. After setting up my account, I navigated to my project directory in the terminal and initialized a Git repository with `git init`. I then added my project files to the repository using `git add .` and made my first commit with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`. Finally, I created a new repository on GitHub, copied the repository URL, and connected my local repository to the GitHub repository using `git remote add origin <repository-url>` and `git push -u origin main`.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
  To install Python and the necessary tools for my project, I followed these steps:

First, I visited (https://www.python.org) and downloaded the installer for the latest version of Python compatible with my operating system. After downloading, I ran the installer and ensured that the option to add Python to the PATH was selected. I followed the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Once Python was installed, I opened a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and verified the installation by running `python --version` and `pip --version` to check that both Python and pip (Python's package installer) were properly installed. Depending on the requirements of my project, I then installed any necessary compilers, interpreters, or runtimes, such as `pip install numpy` for numerical computations or `pip install flask` for web development. Finally, I ensured that I had all the tools needed to build and execute my code by checking the project's documentation and installing any additional dependencies specified.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   
   To download and install MySQL database, I followed these steps:

i went to the download site (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html). I selected the appropriate installer for my operating system and clicked on the download link. Once the installer was downloaded, I ran it and chose the setup type (e.g., Developer Default, Server only, Client only). During the installation process, I followed the on-screen instructions, which included configuring the MySQL server, setting the root password, and creating a MySQL user account. After the installation was complete, I verified that the MySQL server was running by opening the MySQL Command Line Client and logging in with the root account. Finally, I configured MySQL Workbench or another database management tool as needed to manage my databases and ensure I had the necessary tools to create and maintain my database projects.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    I did not encounter any challange so far with setting up my coding learning anvironment apart from the fact that my machine was unable to install the windows 11

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
